class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        visited = set()
        stack = [0]
        while stack:
            room = stack.pop()
            visited.add(room)
            for key in rooms[room]:
                if key not in visited:
                    stack.append(key)
        return len(visited) == len(rooms)
        
        
        
Approach
using stack to append key of each into visited rooms if total visited is equal to length of rooms then return True
[[1, 3], [3, 0, 1], [2], [0]]

visited = [], stack = [0] --> visited = [0], stack = []
vitited = [0], stack = [1, 3] --> visited = [0, 3, 1]
